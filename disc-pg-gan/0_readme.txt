Use environmental.yml to set up env dependencies for running script/slurm jobs.
Test data generated from SLiM simulations are done in "slim_selection_simulation_new" dir,
which reused scripts and followed instructions from https://github.com/mathiesonlab/disc-pg-gan/tree/main/slim_selection_simulation
Shuffling algorithms and jobs to generate final results are in scripts start with number e.g. "1_*" and "2_*"
All other .py scripts are code dependencies copied as is from https://github.com/mathiesonlab/disc-pg-gan
